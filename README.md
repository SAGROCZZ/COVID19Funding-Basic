# It seeks to solve the following problems:

- Addressing the menace of price gouging of critical supplies by decentralised model for mapping the demand and supply of these supplies as localised pricing is often exploitative and without any checkjs and balances.

- Addressing the leakage of funds/resources received by COVID-19 healthcare organisations from generous donors in a bid to revolutionise samaritans’ access to better resources further helping to combat COVID-19 with a more disruptive fool-proof and tested technology i.e. blockchain.

- Implementation of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) model by equal allocation of funds from a pool fund i.e. ‘SOS-Funds-In-Need’ that’ll act as a mother fund to other child funds or beneficiaries registered on this platform with verified COVID+ reports, fund-raising through other unconventional means so as to increase donations are also required as conventional approach as time has tested though encouraging is inadequate.

# The solutions are:

- The issue of leakage is gone away with blockchain as the secure transfer does away with middle men.

- Price gouging can be addressed by having an interconnected supply chain determine price levels capped   by the local jurisdictional limit in case resource  transfer doesn’t correspond the firm will be penalised.

- As elucidated a mother fund, say SOS-Funds-In-Need, will take in all contributions and distribute it to child funds and others in need to proportional tune or requested amount (whichever is lower) this can be easily implemented with a donation formula and the transfer of funds will be handled by blockchain; additionally the scope of monetizing NFTs through a chrity auction will also be explored!
